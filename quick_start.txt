The simplest way to try YSmart is as follows.

Step 1: install YSmart using the following command:

python setup.py install

Step 2: translate a TPC-H query using the following command:

python translation.py test/tpch_test/17.sql test/tpch_test/tpch.schema


The outputs of the translation are in the result/ direstory: (1) the Java codes in YSmartCode/ and (2) a file testquery.script that contains the compile and  execution command. However, the default YSmart does not compile or execute its generated codes unless some configuration options are turned on. Details are in readme.txt.

Good Luck!
